Dear Mr. and Mrs. Zhao,
From the sincerest part of my heart, I would like to apologize for the rude and obtrusive comments that were made earlier to Alex. We all could have handeled the situation better, and the comments that were made just may have made it worse. Hopefully, in the future, Alex and we will be able to move past this, but for now I would like to formally apologize as one of the captains of the robotics team.
Sincerely, 
Ashhal Shamsi
